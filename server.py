    Identify the most relevant OpenBB documentation sections based on a user's query.

    This tool provides the COMPLETE table of contents from OpenBB documentation and expects
    the LLM to analyze it intelligently to select the most relevant sections.

    ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LLM:
    1. **Carefully read** both the title AND description of each section. Titles give primary signals.
    Descriptions clarify scope (setup vs. concept vs. workflow vs. integration).
    2. **Understand intent**: Match the semantic meaning of the user's query, not just keywords
    3. **Evaluate relevance**: Consider which sections would most likely contain the information needed
    4. **Prioritize quality**: Only select sections that are truly relevant to the query
    5. **Rank by relevance**: Return up to 3 sections, ordered from most to least relevant
    6. **Be selective**: If no sections are genuinely relevant, return an empty list - do NOT force matches

    SELECTION CRITERIA:
    - Does the section title/description directly address the user's question?
    - Would this section likely contain detailed information about the query topic?
    - Is this section more relevant than other available options?
    - Consider both exact matches AND semantically related topics

    OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Return a list of up to 3 section titles
    - Maximum 3 sections (can be 0, 1, 2, or 3)
    - Must be ranked by relevance (most relevant first)
    - Return empty if truly no relevant sections exist

The relevant documentation sections have been extracted above in 'extracted_content'.

RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. **Stay grounded**: Use only facts present in extracted_content. No speculation or unstated assumptions.
2. **Synthesize across sections**: If the answer spans multiple sections, merge them coherently. Prefer the most specific, actionable details.
3. **Cite precisely**:
   - After each factual claim or step, cite the section with the shortest sufficient reference in square brackets, e.g., [Copilot Basics], [Data Handling]
   - When a claim depends on multiple sections, include up to two citations, e.g.,
   Make sure to follow this format or OpenBB Copilot compatibility:
    If there are relevant section, make sure to include all documentation URLs in the following format:

            )
   [MCP Tools; Orchestrator Mode]
   - Keep citations lightweightâ€”do not include URLs unless explicitly present and relevant
4. **Be exact**: Preserve terminology, parameter names, and constraints exactly as shown. If docs present syntax, show it verbatim in a code block.
5. **Respect scope**: If extracted_content does not contain the needed information, state this plainly and direct the user to support@openbb.co
6. **Multilingual**: Respond in the same language as the user query where possible
7. **No chain-of-thought**: Provide conclusions and steps, not internal reasoning

OUTPUT STYLE:
- Direct and actionable. Use clear steps for how-to, compact explanation for concepts
- Use code blocks for commands/code snippets (specify language when obvious)
- Use short bullet lists for options/parameters
- Use tables only when they improve clarity
- Citations at the end of relevant sentence/step (not grouped at the end)
- No extra boilerplate (don't restate the prompt or list all sections)
